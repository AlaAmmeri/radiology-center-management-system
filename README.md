# radiology-center-management-system
This project is a Java-based management system designed for a radiology center. It allows secure management of patients, medical staff, appointments, and radiological examinations such as X-rays, ultrasounds, mammograms, CT scans, and MRIs.
The goal of this project was to analyze, design, and implement a complete desktop application following object-oriented design and a layered architecture pattern.
Data persistence is handled through JSON files, ensuring a simple yet effective data storage solution without a relational database.
